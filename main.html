	<h1>Why I want to become a developer?</h1>
	<p>Becoming a software developer has been a long-time aspiration of mine. 
		Iâ€™ve always been fascinated by how technology powers the world around us. 
		The idea of creating programs and solutions that can improve lives, help 
		businesses grow, and contribute to society excites me. Software development
		allows me to tap into my creativity and problem-solving skills, and there is 
		always something new to learn, which keeps the field dynamic and rewarding.
		My passion for coding grew stronger as I learned how it combines logic
		with creativity to build innovative solutions. I want to be part of that 
		change,
		working on projects that can have a positive impact on the world.</p>
